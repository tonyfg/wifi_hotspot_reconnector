# Wifi Hotspot Reconnector

Keep your connection alive on hotspots that disconnect you after a while or a certain amount of traffic.
Works reasonably well on at least some MicrotikOS hotspots.

You need to install phantomjs somewhere on your path and install the selenium-webdriver gem. Then just add your credentials to the @@creds array near the beggining of the script and run it as root.

This also assumes your wifi interface is wlan0.
